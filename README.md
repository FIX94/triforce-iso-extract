# Usage
Grab the [TriIsoExtract.exe](bin/TriIsoExtract.exe?raw=true) and place it into a new folder.  
If you want to have .chd support, then get chdman as well (needs to have CHD v5 support) and put it into the folder of TriIsoExtract.exe.  
Drag and drop your raw binary/track 3 binary/chd file into TriIsoExtract.exe, it should then properly find the actual image in it and write it into a new file.  
This program should at least work with the following GD-ROMs in all their revisions:  
GDT-0001, GDT-0002, GDT-0004, GDT-0005, GDT-0006, GDT-0008, GDT-0009, GDT-0010, GDT-0011, GDT-0013, GDT-0015, GDT-0017, GDT-0020, GDT-0021, GDT-0022


# Manual Compiling
As of right now this is a windows only code. If you have MinGW installed and gcc referenced in your PATH variable just use the "build.bat".  
Support for other OSes might follow in the future.
